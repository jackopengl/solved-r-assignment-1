Question 1

a.    Determine the (i) mode and (ii) class of the diamonds data object.

b.    How would you find how many rows and columns the object has by using R functions nrow and ncol ? Give the code and the result.

c.     What is the value contained in row 12345 and the depth column (which contains the depth percentage)?

d.    Write a line of code that creates a new data object called diamonds_imp which is of the same mode and class as the original diamonds data object and contains the same columns as the original, but also contains three new columns: x_imp , y_imp , z_imp where each of these measurements are Imperial measurements in inches, i.e. x_imp is equal to x divided by 25.4, as there are 25.4 mm in 1 inch. Show the first 6 rows of the resulting data object.

e.    Write a line of code that adds a column named over_under to the diamonds_imp data object that contains the difference between the price of the diamond in that row and the median of the prices of other diamonds with the same color .

f.      Write a line of code that creates a new data object from the original diamonds data object named

Expensive that contains only the diamonds whose price is strictly greater than $18800 and show the contents of that data object.
